# Empack Implementation Status

## 1. V1 Migration Progress

**Assessment:** Medium Confidence

The `empack` project is currently in the process of migrating from a v1 architecture to a more robust and modular v2 architecture. The presence of a `v1` directory suggests that the migration is not yet complete.

**Completed Migrations:**
- **Core Primitives:** The foundational data types, enums, and error-handling strategies have been successfully migrated to the `primitives` module in `empack-lib`.
- **Configuration Management:** The configuration loading and management has been migrated to the `application` module, using a combination of `dotenvy`, `envy`, and `clap`.
- **Logging and Display:** The logging and display systems have been migrated to the `logger` and `display` modules, respectively.

**Pending Migrations:**
- **Command Logic:** The core command logic from the `v1` directory needs to be migrated to the `application` module in `empack-lib`.
- **Build Logic:** The build logic for creating modpacks and installers needs to be migrated to the `empack` module.
- **Testing Framework:** The testing framework from `v1` needs to be migrated and integrated with the new `v2` architecture.

## 2. Missing Features

**Assessment:** Low Confidence

Based on the current state of the codebase, the following features appear to be missing or incomplete:

- **Modpack Building:** The core functionality of building modpacks (`.mrpack` files) and installers is not yet implemented in the `v2` architecture.
- **Dependency Resolution:** The logic for resolving and downloading mod dependencies from sources like Modrinth and CurseForge is not yet implemented.
- **State Management:** While the `ModpackState` enum defines the different states of a modpack, the logic for transitioning between these states is not yet implemented.
- **User Interface:** The `display` module provides the foundation for a rich user interface, but the actual UI elements (e.g., progress bars, spinners) are not yet implemented.

## 3. Actionable Recommendations

- **Prioritize V1 Migration:** The highest priority should be to complete the migration of the remaining functionality from the `v1` directory to the `v2` architecture. This will help to eliminate technical debt and provide a solid foundation for implementing new features.
- **Develop a Feature Roadmap:** Create a feature roadmap to prioritize the implementation of the missing features. This will help to ensure that the most important features are implemented first and that the project stays on track.
- **Implement a Proof of Concept:** Before implementing the full-featured modpack building and dependency resolution logic, it would be beneficial to create a small proof of concept to validate the design and identify any potential issues.
- **Focus on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** To get the project to a usable state as quickly as possible, focus on implementing a minimum viable product (MVP) that includes the core features of building a simple modpack with a few dependencies.
