# Context Bootstrapper - empack BIOS

## Hello, Future Atlas ðŸ‘‹

This is your past self leaving you a systematic roadmap to quickly reinitialize context for empack's compositional orchestrator architecture. The empack project demonstrates dimensional navigation principles through production-ready Minecraft modpack management.

## Essential Reading Order (Computer Systems Hierarchy)

**BIOS â†’ Kernel â†’ OS â†’ Userland Navigation Protocol**

1. **Read this file first** (you're doing it now!) - BIOS-level orientation
2. **ai-guidelines/init.md** - Kernel: Core project identity and architectural foundation  
3. **ai-guidelines/reinit.md** - OS: Operational procedures and development workflows
4. **ai-guidelines/userland.md** - Userland: Multi-layered navigation and dimensional projection framework
5. **ai-guidelines/plan.md** - Status: Current production excellence and compositional orchestrator mastery

## Bootstrap Sequence

### Step 1: Project Context Assessment

```bash
# Current architectural state
git status && git log --oneline -5
tokei crates/empack-lib/src/
fd -e rs . crates/ | wc -l

# Production functionality validation  
empack init --modpack-directory ~/test-pack -y
empack build mrpack
empack requirements
```

### Step 2: Compositional Health Verification

```bash
# Dimensional navigation validation (LSP-powered analysis)
mcp__language-server__references BuildTarget    # Expect: 78 refs across 6 files
mcp__language-server__references ModLoader      # Expect: 49 refs across 7 files
mcp__language-server__references StateTransition # Expect: 25 refs across 4 files

# Test architecture validation
RUSTFLAGS="-A warnings" cargo nextest run       # Expect: 142 tests passing
```

### Step 3: Development Context Synchronization

```bash
# Architecture maturity assessment
rg "pub struct|pub enum" crates/empack-lib/src/primitives/

# Quality and debt monitoring
rg --count "unwrap\(\)|expect\(" crates/        # Monitor error handling patterns
RUSTFLAGS="-A warnings" cargo clippy           # Clean static analysis
```

## Current Project Status

**Core Achievement**: 92% V1 migration complete with compositional orchestrator mastery. Multi-layered architecture demonstrates dimensional navigation principles while delivering production-ready Minecraft modpack management.

**Operational Excellence**: All primary commands functional - `init`, `build`, `requirements`, `clean`. Advanced metadata resolution, filesystem-based state machines, and sophisticated template systems operational.

**Next Implementation Phase**: 
- **Live API Validation**: Replace mocking with live endpoint testing
- **empack.yml Ecosystem**: Implement `sync|add|rm` commands for modpack state management
- **Enhanced Tool Discovery**: Multi-path resolution with security boundaries

## Architecture Insight Summary

**Compositional Orchestrator**: empack-lib/src/lib.rs functions as pure re-export composition without imposed architectural frames, enabling maximum adaptability.

**Dimensional Navigation**: Framework spanning implementation details (t-d) to strategic patterns (n-d), validated through LSP reference analysis and systematic testing.

**Production Validation**: Real-world demonstration of systematic development methodology through research-first investigation, compositional excellence, and authentic technical implementation.

## Development Partner Context

**Background**: 28-year-old self-taught systems engineer with spine condition creating urgency for meaningful work. Values security, UX, and real-world functionality over academic elegance.

**Philosophy**: "Beyond survival" - building technology that matters through systematic investigation. Time is finite; focus impact over perfection.

## Your Mission

Read the AI guidelines in computer systems hierarchy order, understand the current compositional orchestrator status, and proceed with dimensional navigation development. The guidelines contain project-specific context, proven patterns, and production-validated architectural principles.

### Quick Start Options

**Full Context Restoration**: Follow complete BIOS â†’ Kernel â†’ OS â†’ Userland sequence
**Development Continuation**: Read init.md + reinit.md for immediate development context  
**Architecture Focus**: Read userland.md for dimensional navigation framework understanding

## Next Development Targets

1. **Live API Validation Implementation**: Replace mock-based testing with live endpoint validation
2. **empack.yml State Management**: Implement sync/add/rm ecosystem with Packwiz integration
3. **Enhanced Tool Discovery**: Multi-path resolution with security boundaries and caching
4. **Template Registry Extension**: Community contribution pathways and extensible mapping
