Lovely! Let's talk documents for a second. A few things I'd like before we move on to terminal perhaps?

(1) read reinit.md and init.md
(2) rewrite init.md
(3) rewrite reinit.md (optional)

Prepare for a comprehensive Git commit chain:

(a) git diff/status | this is not a clean, Rust repo - it's the old empack repo with previous content organized in ./v{1,2}/ sub-dirs, and the rest of the root is the Rust project itself

(b) we need one (1) commit simply moving all previously git tracked files into their new locations - it's okay there are slight duplications

(c) we need one (1) commit bootstrapping the initial Cargo/Rust project (ignore the src folder entirely)

(d) we need any number (n) of commits showing progression of src from just main.rs to all of the current modules present (that are NOT stubbed, check `wc -l ./src/**/.rs` or `tokei src`)

Instead of doing all of the work yourself, let's do this together, incrementally. First, let's verify the non-commit git commands necessary to stage the relevant files for each commit. Then, I'll have you write a message and commit each staged change based on the current commit styling (`git log --pretty=medium -n 3`) with these overrides if necessary:
  - short subjects with convential guideline-styled action (80 character max)
  - bullet points describing staged changes
  - lowercase the starting/first word of each staged change description (but you're free to capitalize otherwise)
  - no summary or footers surrounding list of staged changes
  - no Claude Code/AI attribution message

Let's begin!
