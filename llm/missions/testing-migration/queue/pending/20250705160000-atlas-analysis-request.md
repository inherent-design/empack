# Large-Scale Codebase Analysis Request

## Context

Testing migration mission is 90% complete with high-priority tasks done:
- ✅ Unit test patterns established (*.test.rs files)
- ✅ Integration test patterns established (tests/ directories)
- ✅ All tests passing (124 total)
- ⚠️ Remaining: E2E test patterns (empack-tests crate)

## Analysis Scope

Need comprehensive analysis of:

### 1. Current Test Distribution
- Analyze all 124 existing tests across the codebase
- Identify test categories and coverage patterns
- Map which tests could benefit from migration to new patterns

### 2. Potential E2E Test Scenarios
- Analyze `empack init`, `build`, `requirements`, `clean` workflows
- Identify integration points requiring full system validation
- Review state machine transitions that need end-to-end coverage

### 3. Test Architecture Optimization
- Review current test isolation patterns
- Identify opportunities for better compositional test boundaries
- Assess memory leak patterns and resource management

### 4. Missing Test Coverage
- Analyze areas lacking systematic testing
- Identify edge cases in build orchestration
- Review platform capability detection coverage

## Gemini Capabilities Needed

1. **Large Context Analysis**: Process entire codebase (1M+ tokens)
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring test patterns and opportunities
3. **Strategic Synthesis**: Generate comprehensive migration roadmap
4. **LSP Integration**: Use language server for accurate reference analysis

## Expected Deliverables

1. Test migration priority matrix
2. E2E test architecture proposal
3. Specific file recommendations for migration
4. Resource optimization opportunities

## Files for Analysis

Please analyze:
- All `crates/empack-lib/src/**/*.rs` files
- Current test patterns and isolation strategies  
- Build orchestration and state management flows
- Platform detection and tool discovery patterns

This analysis will guide the final phase of testing migration and establish the foundation for empack-tests crate development.
