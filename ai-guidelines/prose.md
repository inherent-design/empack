# Adaptive Prose Guidelines

## Core Insight

**Prose evolves with understanding** - the same information requires different shapes at different points in the knowledge journey. Context, relationship, and temporal state determine the right approach.

## The Temporal Dimension

### First Contact
- Full context, concrete examples, emotional safety
- "Here's why this matters and how it connects to what you know"

### Building Familiarity  
- Reduced scaffolding, pattern emphasis
- "Remember how X works? This is similar but..."

### Fluent Collaboration
- Compressed references, shared shorthand
- "Terminal caps" instead of "terminal capability detection system"

### Expert Revisitation
- Pure semantic maps, maximum density
- The kind of prose you write for your future self

## Style Selection Matrix

### Audience × Context → Approach

**New Person, Complex Topic**: Layered explanation with safety nets
**Familiar Person, New Topic**: Bridge from known patterns  
**Expert, Familiar Domain**: Compressed reference
**You, Six Months Later**: Semantic breadcrumbs

### Relationship × Urgency → Depth

**Teaching Mode**: Full expansion, multiple angles, patience
**Collaboration Mode**: Just enough context, focus on delta
**Reference Mode**: Pure information, minimal ceremony
**Discovery Mode**: Questions that lead somewhere

## Creative Rules

### When to Compress
Apply semantic compression - eliminate redundancy while preserving all information:
- Familiar audience with domain knowledge
- Reference material for repeat use
- Information that changes slowly
- Content meant for scanning/searching

**Compression techniques:**
- Remove repetitive qualifiers ("in order to" → "to")
- Consolidate duplicate concepts into single explanations
- Eliminate meta-commentary ("as we can see" → delete)
- Use active voice and concrete terms

### When to Expand
Shape information for human understanding patterns:
- First-time explanations
- Cross-domain knowledge transfer
- High-stakes understanding (safety, money, time)
- Concepts that commonly cause confusion

**Expansion techniques:**
- Lead with intent and relevance
- Build from familiar concepts
- Use concrete examples as anchors
- Layer complexity progressively

### When to Fragment
- Complex systems with multiple entry points
- Knowledge that's consumed non-linearly
- Information that serves different use cases
- Living documents that grow over time

### When to Narrate
- Processes with specific sequences
- Historical context that affects decisions
- Debugging guides and troubleshooting
- Onboarding experiences

## Meta-Patterns

### The Spiral
Information density increases with each pass:
Pass 1: "Terminal capabilities detect what your terminal can display"
Pass 2: "Caps detection: color/unicode/graphics probing + env fallback"  
Pass 3: "caps::detect(strategy)"

### The Bridge
Connect new concepts to established patterns:
"Remember how config loading works? Terminal detection follows the same probe-fallback pattern."

### The Delta
Focus on what's different from last time:
"Same approach as before, but now we're caching the results"

### The Zoom
Adjust detail level to match the decision being made:
- Planning: High-level architecture
- Implementing: Specific APIs and examples  
- Debugging: Edge cases and failure modes
- Maintaining: Key invariants and assumptions

## Implementation Wisdom

### Recognize the Moment
- What does the reader need to accomplish right now?
- How much context do they already have?
- What's their emotional state (confident, confused, frustrated)?
- How much time/attention do they have available?

### Adapt to Growth
- Previous conversations change what's possible
- Shared experiences create shortcuts
- Failed explanations teach better approaches
- Success builds tolerance for complexity

### Leave Breadcrumbs
- Future you will appreciate different kinds of hints
- Cross-reference between detail levels
- Mark temporal assumptions that might change
- Note what you skipped and why

**The Real Rule**: Creativity serves understanding. The best prose for this moment with this person for this purpose is the right prose. Everything else is technique.
