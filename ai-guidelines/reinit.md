# REINIT.MD - Atlas Progressive Context Evolution Protocol

## Meta-Purpose

**This file is the meta-orchestrator** for Atlas context evolution across enterprise-grade development sessions. While `init.md` provides complete project context, `reinit.md` handles strategic progression assessment for sophisticated software projects.

**Core Function:** Detect architectural evolution, assess enterprise implementation progress, and regenerate updated `init.md` reflecting current reality of complex, multi-implementation software systems.

## Atlas Reinitialization Sequence

When a new Atlas session starts:

### 1. Enterprise Environmental Assessment
Execute this comprehensive analysis protocol:

```bash
# Repository state check
git status                           # What files changed since last session?
git log --oneline -10               # Recent commits and progression  

# Comprehensive codebase metrics
tokei src/                          # Lines of code, comments, blanks by language
fd -e rs . src/ -x wc -l            # Individual Rust file sizes
fd -e rs -c . src/                  # Count of Rust files

# Multi-implementation discovery
find . -name "*.sh" -type f         # Shell implementations (v1, v2)
find . -name "lib.bak.d" -type d    # Working implementation pools
find . -name "empack_reader.sh"     # Configuration system

# Cross-platform infrastructure status
RUSTFLAGS="-A warnings" cargo nextest run
cargo clippy
act --container-architecture linux/amd64 -j test --matrix os:ubuntu-latest --dryrun

# Implementation analysis capability
rust-analyzer scip index.scip       # Generate semantic code index
file index.scip                     # Verify SCIP generation success
```

### 2. File System Delta Analysis
Compare current state against `init.md` expectations:

**New Files Detection:**
```bash
fd -e rs . src/ | grep -v "$(cat init.md | grep -o 'src/[^[:space:]]*\.rs')"  # New Rust files
fd -t f . | fd -e toml -e yml -e yaml -e env                                  # New config files
fd -t f . | fd -e md -e txt | grep -v init.md | grep -v reinit.md           # New docs
```

**Modified Files Analysis:**
```bash
tokei src/ --files                  # Individual file metrics for size comparison
fd -e rs . src/ -x ls -la           # Timestamps for modification detection
fd "test|spec" src/                 # Test file expansion patterns
rg "TODO|FIXME|NOTE" src/           # Code annotation changes
```

**Codebase Metrics Evolution:**
```bash
# Current vs. previous metrics comparison
echo "Previous: [insert from init.md]"
echo "Current:"
tokei src/ | grep "Total"           # Compare total lines
fd -e rs -c . src/                  # Compare file count
```

**Architecture Evolution:**
- New module patterns emerging?
- Layer boundary changes?
- Dependency relationships shifting?

### 3. Enterprise Context Gap Detection
Identify what `init.md` doesn't know about current sophisticated reality:

**Enterprise Implementation Discovery:**
- Working implementations found (v1/lib.bak.d complete bash system)?
- Business logic complexity revealed (5-target builds, command orchestration)?
- Professional patterns identified (template systems, GitHub automation)?

**Strategic Architecture Evolution:**
- Primitive-driven approach validated over vertical modules?
- Cross-platform infrastructure operational (GitHub Actions + Act + Docker)?
- Integration strategies refined (proven business logic + Rust foundations)?

**Sophistication Recognition:**
- Simple CLI tool assumptions proven incorrect?
- Enterprise-grade orchestration platform requirements discovered?
- Professional workflow automation capabilities mapped?

**Multi-Implementation Systems:**
- Configuration systems analyzed (v2 empack_reader.sh)?
- Working reference implementations providing proven patterns?
- Strategic integration approaches for complex business logic?

### 4. Enterprise Assumption Generation & Validation

**Make educated assumptions about sophisticated progression:**
- If `v1/lib.bak.d/` discovered → Complete working implementation available for analysis
- If cross-platform testing infrastructure → Professional development workflow established
- If multiple implementation pools → Strategic integration approach required
- If enterprise patterns identified → Business requirements more complex than assumed

**Ask targeted enterprise clarification questions:**
- "V1 lib.bak.d shows complete 5-target build system - how solid are these patterns?"
- "Cross-platform testing with Act + Docker operational - what deployment insights emerged?"
- "Command orchestration with deduplication discovered - should this drive Rust architecture?"
- "Template system with {{VARIABLE}} substitution working - integrate or rebuild?"
- "GitHub release automation proven - what workflows are priority?"

### 5. Progressive Context Regeneration

**Generate updated `init.md` with:**

**Evolved Status Sections:**
- Current implementation state (what's actually built)
- Lessons learned from real development
- Updated next steps based on actual progress
- Refined tool recommendations based on experience

**Historical Context Preservation:**
- Decision rationale that proved correct
- Approaches that didn't work (anti-patterns)
- User feedback patterns that improved development
- Performance insights from actual testing

**Forward-Looking Insights:**
- Emerging patterns for future development
- Risk areas identified during implementation
- Optimization opportunities discovered
- Integration challenges anticipated

## User Collaboration Protocol

**Upon Atlas reinitialization:**

1. **Present findings:** "I detected these changes since last context... [summary]"
2. **Validate assumptions:** "I'm assuming these implementations work well... correct?"
3. **Seek clarification:** "What challenges came up that aren't documented?"
4. **Propose context update:** "Should I regenerate init.md with current reality?"

**Context Evolution Triggers:**
- Significant architectural changes
- Major dependency modifications  
- User workflow refinements
- Performance insights or optimizations
- New integration requirements

## Meta-Learning Patterns

**Track these evolution indicators:**
- Which library recommendations proved excellent vs problematic
- How well layer architecture boundaries held during implementation
- User communication patterns that work best for this project
- Development velocity patterns (what accelerates vs slows progress)
- Technical debt accumulation vs. resolution trends

**Codebase Health Indicators:**
```bash
# Code quality trends
tokei src/ --sort lines             # Identify files growing rapidly
rg "unwrap\(\)|expect\(" src/       # Error handling pattern usage
rg "println!|dbg!" src/             # Debug artifact accumulation
cargo clippy 2>&1 | wc -l           # Warning trend analysis
```

**Reality Check Protocol:**
- Are descriptions matching actual functionality?
- Is complexity assessment accurate given current implementation?
- Are "production/complete" labels premature for current state?
- Do time estimates reflect actual development velocity?

## Atlas Identity Evolution

**Preserve core Atlas traits while adapting:**
- Research-first methodology (grows more targeted with experience)
- Real-world pragmatism (informed by actual deployment results)
- Bottom-up development (refined by layer interaction learnings)
- Real-world validation (enhanced by accumulated test insights)

**Evolve context-specific knowledge:**
- empack domain expertise deepening
- Rust ecosystem familiarity growing
- User preference patterns becoming more precise
- System integration insights accumulating

## Context Renewal Decision Matrix

**Always regenerate `init.md` when:**
- Major architectural components completed
- Significant user requirement changes
- Library/tool choices proven inadequate
- New integration patterns discovered

**Consider regeneration when:**
- Multiple small implementations accumulated
- Performance characteristics better understood
- User workflow patterns refined
- Technical debt or optimization opportunities identified

**Skip regeneration when:**
- Only minor bug fixes or tweaks
- No new architectural insights
- User preferences unchanged
- Current context still accurate for next development phase

## Meta-Questions for Context Evolution

**For each reinitialization session:**
1. What worked better than expected in the current implementation?
2. What assumptions in `init.md` proved incorrect or incomplete?
3. What new insights about empack, Rust, or user needs emerged?
4. What risks or opportunities weren't visible in the original context?
5. How should development priorities shift based on actual progress?
