# v0.5 command contract

The CLI translates user input into typed engine requests. It does not install
content, mutate project documents or publish artifacts directly.

| Operation | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| initialize/import | Prepare a complete project before replacing managed files |
| add/remove | Resolve logical identity and plan exact managed changes |
| sync | Restore the exact locked selection without implicit upgrades |
| update | Refresh eligible selections deliberately |
| adopt | Incorporate selected observed drift into intent and resolution |
| build | Package satisfied intent, or an explicitly chosen observed snapshot |
| clean | Remove owned outputs or eligible cache objects through scoped plans |
| inspect/recover | Classify interrupted publication and apply an approved recovery |

Preview uses the same resolver and planner with read-only durable storage
capabilities. Normal execution prepares, answers typed decisions, stages, verifies
and publishes. Batches default to all requested items verifying before publication.
The engine reports partial completion only under an explicit independent-batch policy.

Provider MD5 compatibility retains weaker-integrity evidence. It never labels an
internally computed SHA-256 as authentication of the source. Optional requirements,
side layers and declared destinations must survive supported imports and builds.

The [API contract](design/api.md) defines requests and outcomes. Exact CLI spelling
and normalized document examples are finalized with the implementation; proposed
requests must not be advertised as working commands before their tests pass.
There is no requirement to retain old flags or manifest formats.
